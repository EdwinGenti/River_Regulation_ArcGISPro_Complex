<h1>The rational method: Estimation of Peak Discharge for the Pouri River with ArcGIS Pro</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>

A university works, to estimate the peak discharge for the Pouri River in three different return periods. Made during my Erasmus in Greece<br>
The works take the form of a calculation explanation (The calculation named "Rational Method"). The parameters needed for the calculations will be get by ArcGIS Pro
<br>
<br>
This work can be used by cities, public infrastructures, hydrology companies or others, to determine the harzard level of a sub-basin
<br>
The study was made possible by Farisotou Evangelia, my university professor at the University of Thessaly
